In the following we address their concerns point by point. 

> - p.2: The first paragraph: The term _WMS_ is used before introducing _Workflow Management System_ that is introduced in the fourth paragraph in p.2.

We have provided the full form and introduced the abbreviation to be used later.

> **Editor notes:**  As a CWL paper it would be good to put any workflows highlighted here into the CWL viewer tool, include permalinks for any figures using the workflows, and sending us RO bundles for them to archive in GigaDB.

We have added the GigaDB link to Section _Availability of supporting data and materials_. This link contains snapshot of the data and methods utilised in this study. 

We have also provided additional CWL Viewer links as suggested by GigaScience editor.
